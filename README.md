Derivable 3

For my deliverable 3, I had to style my html for the web page, especially focusing on mobile phones. For this work, I had the python code (csv_to_athletes_html.py) that would create all the html, and from there, I should create the css file to complement them. I also needed to create a home page, and therefore I created a css file for that page. However, it was short, and not many things were implemented in it.
In my CSS file, I have focused on a clean and user-friendly design. Below are the key components and techniques used:


Header Styles:
Center-aligned the header text with a background color of dark blue (#003366) and white text.
Implemented a responsive design for the header with appropriate padding and a pop effect for an image upon clicking.
Navigation Menu:
Created a horizontal navigation bar that allows for overflow scrolling on smaller screens.
Utilized flexbox to arrange navigation links, with hover effects for improved user interaction.
Included a sticky summary section within the navigation for easier access to options.
Main Content Area:
Defined padding for the main content to enhance readability.
Styled headings with distinct colors and font sizes to differentiate sections.
Athlete Result Table:
Utilized a grid layout for displaying athlete results, ensuring responsive behavior and horizontal scrolling capability.
Included animations for hover effects on table rows to enhance user experience.
Implemented alternating row colors for improved readability and a sticky header for easy navigation.
Dark Mode Support:
Added media queries to adapt the layout for users who prefer dark mode, ensuring proper contrast and visibility for backgrounds and text.
Footer Styles:
Designed a footer that aligns text centrally, maintaining the theme with a dark blue background and white text.
Incorporated link hover effects for consistency with the navigation links.
Iconography:
Included styles for Font Awesome brand icons, enhancing visual appeal.


Therefore, the main elements Iâ€™ve included in my css file are: 
CSS Flexbox: For layout arrangement in navigation and the result table.
Keyframes and Animations: For creating engaging visual effects on images and table rows.
Media Queries: To ensure responsiveness and support for different color schemes (light and dark mode).
Grid Layout: For organizing athlete results efficiently.
